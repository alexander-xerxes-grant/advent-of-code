# To solve this you need to parse the strategy guide to determine what the actions of each player
# will be. Then for each round you will need to determine the outcome (W, L, or D) of the round.
# next, calculate the score for each round. The score for a round is the sum of the score
# for each actions (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, 3 for Scissors) and the score for the outcomes
# (0 for loss, 3 for draw, and 6 for win).
# Finally, add up the scores for all of the rounds to get the final score.

# 1. Parse the strategy guide to determine the actions for each player in each round.
# 2. Determine the outcome of each round (win, loss, or draw) based on the actions of both players.
# 3. Calculate the score for each round by adding the score for the action and the score for the outcome.
# 4. Add up the scores for all of the rounds to get the final score.
