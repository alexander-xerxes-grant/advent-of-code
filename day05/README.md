Parse the input: The first step would be to read and parse the input, which consists of a list of stacks of crates and a list of rearrangement steps. One way to represent the stacks of crates is to use a list of lists, where each inner list represents a stack and contains the crates in the order they are stacked (from bottom to top).

Implement the rearrangement procedure: Next, you'll need to implement the rearrangement procedure described in the input. This involves moving crates from one stack to another, one at a time. You can do this by removing the top crate from the source stack and adding it to the top of the destination stack.

Execute the rearrangement steps: Once you have implemented the procedure for moving crates between stacks, you can loop through the list of rearrangement steps and execute each one in turn.

Output the final stack configuration: After all the steps have been executed, the stacks should be in their final configuration. You can output the top crate in each stack by accessing the first element of each inner list (since the crates are stacked from bottom to top).
